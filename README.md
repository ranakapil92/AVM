# SVM

Run in Spyder or run with python3.5. Please insure the datafile “iris.data” same folder. First
line is for running SVM with no data and second line is SVM with IRIS data. You can run both
parallelly in separate terminal but it might slow your system.

python3.5 SVM.py
python3.5 SVM_IRIS.py

One important thing in SVM.py, we are taking input from user for selecting between
linear_svm, kernel_svm, soft_svm. If you don’t want this interactive version, just go to
bottom of code SVM.py, remove the loop.

2. Please install modules required

a. CVXOPT: for solving optimization problem

b. numpy: for matrix operations

c. matplotlib: for plotting data

d. math: for some mathematical op
